# Feature Specification: Budget-Aware Strike Filtering & Selection Validation

## 1. Overview
The current strike selection flow may surface unactionable choices that exceed a user’s configured budget, which can lead to failed order attempts and erode trust.  
This feature introduces budget-aware filtering and selection validation with progressive disclosure: unaffordable strikes are hidden by default, while an explicit override preserves expert control.

## 2. Users & Use Cases
- **Budget-constrained trader** — wants default views limited to actionable (affordable) strikes.  
- **Experienced trader** — wants the option to reveal and intentionally select unaffordable strikes.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### Core Behavior
1. **The system must** compute affordability per strike: `askPrice × contractSize ≤ maxBudget`.  
2. **The system must** hide unaffordable strikes by default.  
3. **The system must** display a count and reason: “X strikes hidden due to budget constraints.”  
4. **The system must** provide a toggle to reveal/hide unaffordable strikes.  
5. **The system must NOT** auto-select unaffordable strikes.  
6. **The system must** allow manual selection of unaffordable strikes as an explicit override.  
7. **The system must** default quantity to 0 when no affordable strikes exist.  
8. **The system must** preserve manual selections during toggle changes.

### Visual Feedback (non-binding)
- Consistent status text indicating hidden count.  
- Distinct styling/tinting for unaffordable strikes when revealed.

### Integration Constraints
- Applies to strike tables independently.  
- Budget logic does not constrain short strikes used to finance long exposure.  
- Sorting/ordering rules remain unchanged.

## 4. Constraints (“Build the Fence”)
**Explicit NOTs**  
- No dynamic budget auto-reselections (future)  
- No blocking modals; emphasis on transparency and control  
- No quantity optimization in this phase  
- No cross-table budget coupling  
- No budget recommendations

**Phasing**  
- **Phase 1**: filtering, visibility toggle, manual override, stable messaging  
- **Phase 2**: dynamic updates, advanced warnings, preference storage

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- Given an unaffordable strike, the system does not auto-select it.  
- Given hidden strikes, the status shows an accurate count and reason.  
- Given a manual override, the selection persists across toggle changes.  
- Given zero affordable strikes, quantity defaults to 0.

## 6. Success Metrics
- 0% auto-selection of unaffordable strikes  
- 100% successful manual overrides when initiated  
- Reduction in failed order attempts due to affordability (baseline vs. post-launch)

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Confusion about hidden items** → Explicit count + reason text  
- **Loss of expert control** → Manual override preserved and obvious

## 8. Telemetry & Audit
- Event: `budget_hidden_count` (symbol, expiry, hidden_count)  
- Event: `budget_override_selected` (strike, affordability_gap)  
- Event: `order_attempt_blocked` (reason: affordability)

## 9. Rollout & Reversibility
- Feature flag gated; allowlist for pilot users.  
- Reversion plan: disable flag; fallback to previous table behavior.

## 10. Open Questions
1. Should the “reveal” toggle appear where budget does not apply? (Consistency vs. clarity)
2. Should the toggle preference persist between sessions? (If yes, local persistence + privacy note)
