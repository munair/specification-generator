# Freeform Specification Generator

This document is for **exploration, ideation, and creative overflow** before snapping back into a formal feature specification.  
It is intentionally loose. Use it to let the AI (or the human writer) **wander the playground** before the fence goes up.

- What problem, frustration, or opportunity sparked this feature idea?  
- What excites you most about solving it?

## 5. Rough Sketch

## 6. Notes Dump

- Any stray thoughts, side ideas, or “what-ifs” to capture now.  
- Even if they don’t fit, record them here for later pruning.

> After freeform exploration, migrate the essentials into either:
> - `/templates/feature-specification-template-simple.md` for straightforward features  
> - `/templates/feature-specification-template-full.md` for complex, strategic features  
> Keep both documents: the freeform generator captures **breadth**, the PRD captures **focus**.
