# Guidelines Directory

This directory contains the core framework documents for generating high-quality feature specifications.

## Contents

### `guidelines-for-creatively-generating-feature-specifications.md`
The **primary approach** / main framework for most PRDs. This document guides AI assistants to create comprehensive specifications through structured conversation.

**Key Features:**
- Clarifying Questions Framework (Essential, Scope Control, Context-Dependent)
- PRD Structure (Quick Start vs Full Process)
- Guiding Principles including "Creative Abandon Within Scope"
- Process Flow with critical checkpoints
- Feature Tagging Strategy with descriptive naming approach
- Implementation Journey Best Practices
- Testing Considerations and real-world scenarios

### `guidelines-for-freeform-feature-specification-generation.md`
A **creative fallback approach** for when the primary guidelines aren't producing desired results OR when you specifically need innovative solutions or want to explore wild ideas before constraining them.

**Key Features:**
- The Spark (problem identification)
- Dream Scenario exploration
- Failure Mode analysis
- Metaphor development
- Notes capture for later refinement
- Feature Tagging Strategy for implementation tracking

## How to Use

1. **Start with Primary Approach**: Use the formal guidelines for most feature requests
2. **Use Templates as Few-Shot Examples**: Include template examples in AI prompts to show "what good looks like"
3. **Fallback to Freeform**: Only when primary approach fails OR you need creative solutions / wild ideas
4. **Apply Tagging Strategy**: Use descriptive tags for implementation tracking

## Three-Way Framework

- **Primary (Formal)**: Handles 80% of scenarios efficiently
- **Few-Shot Templates**: Teaching examples and manual creation
- **Freeform (Fallback)**: Creative rescue when structured approaches fail

All three approaches may be used independently or in combination to ensure comprehensive, focused feature specifications that prevent scope creep while enabling creative solutions when needed.
