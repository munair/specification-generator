# Guidelines Directory

This directory contains the core framework documents for generating high-quality feature specifications.

## Contents

### `guidelines-for-creatively-generating-feature-specifications.md`
The main framework document that guides AI assistants to create comprehensive PRDs. This is the primary tool for teams using AI to generate specifications.

**Key Features:**
- Clarifying Questions Framework (Essential, Scope Control, Context-Dependent)
- PRD Structure (Quick Start vs Full Process)
- Guiding Principles including "Creative Abandon Within Scope"
- Process Flow with critical checkpoints
- Real-world examples and templates

### `guidelines-for-freeform-feature-specification-generation.md`
A creative exploration tool for brainstorming before formal specification. Use this when you need to explore wild ideas before constraining them.

**Key Features:**
- The Spark (problem identification)
- Dream Scenario exploration
- Failure Mode analysis
- Metaphor development
- Notes capture for later refinement

## How to Use

1. **For AI-Generated PRDs**: Copy the main guidelines file to your AI assistant context
2. **For Creative Exploration**: Use the freeform guide before formal specification
3. **For Manual Templates**: Use the templates in the `/templates/` directory

Both guidelines work together to ensure comprehensive, focused feature specifications that prevent scope creep while enabling creative solutions.
