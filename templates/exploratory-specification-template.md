## The Spark
[What triggered this exploration? What problem keeps coming up? What opportunity do we sense but can't quite articulate?]

## Dream Scenario
If we could wave a magic wand and have the perfect solution tomorrow, what would it look like? How would users feel? What would be different about their experience?

### The Wildest Version
[If there were NO constraints - no budget, time, or technical limitations - what would we build?]

### The Elegant Version
[What's the simplest, most beautiful solution that would still delight users?]

### The Practical Version
[What could we actually build in the next sprint that would move us toward the dream?]

## Current Pain Points
- [Specific frustration users experience]
- [Inefficiency in current approach]
- [Missing capability that causes workarounds]
- [Technical debt creating barriers]

## Metaphors & Mental Models
[What analogies help explain this problem/solution?]

### Metaphor 1: [Analogy]
This is like [familiar concept] because [explanation]. This suggests we should [insight].

### Metaphor 2: [Different Analogy]
Think of it as [familiar concept]. The key insight is [realization].

## Technical Spikes Needed
1. **Spike**: [Technical question to answer]
   - **Approach**: [How to investigate]
   - **Success Criteria**: [What confirms viability]
   - **Time Box**: [Maximum investigation time]

2. **Spike**: [Another technical question]
   - **Approach**: [Investigation method]
   - **Success Criteria**: [Viability indicator]
   - **Time Box**: [Maximum time]

## User Research Questions
- How do users currently work around this problem?
- What would users give up to have this solution?
- Which users would benefit most?
- What unexpected uses might emerge?

## Constraints Discovery
As we explore, what constraints are we discovering?

### Hard Constraints (Immutable)
- [Technical limitation]
- [Regulatory requirement]
- [Resource constraint]

### Soft Constraints (Negotiable)
- [Current architecture preference]
- [Team familiarity]
- [Timeline pressure]

## Success Indicators
How will we know if this exploration is succeeding?

- [Early signal of promise]
- [Validation milestone]
- [User excitement indicator]
- [Technical breakthrough needed]

## Notes & Random Thoughts
[Capture everything - brilliant ideas, crazy notions, half-formed thoughts]

## Next Steps

### To Validate Technically
1. [Build proof of concept for X]
2. [Benchmark approach Y]
3. [Research library/pattern Z]

### To Validate with Users
1. [Show mockup of approach A]
2. [Discuss pain points around B]
3. [Gather feedback on priority]

### To Formalize
Once we've identified the winning approach:
1. Choose domain: Backend or Frontend
2. Migrate insights to formal specification
3. Define clear boundaries (the "fence")
4. Apply systematic requirements gathering

## Migration Checkpoint
**Ready to formalize when**:
☐ Core approach identified
☐ Technical feasibility confirmed
☐ User value validated
☐ Constraints understood
☐ Domain (Backend/Frontend) clear

## Archival Note
Once formalized and implemented, this exploration will follow standard archival:
- Create formal PRD using domain-specific guideline
- Generate task list with `guidelines-for-generating-tasks.md`
- Follow ARCHIVAL PROTOCOL for completion
- Tag with `[feature]-[breakthrough-pattern]`

## Creative License
This is a safe space for wild ideas. Nothing is too crazy to write down. The best solutions often come from "impossible" ideas that we figure out how to make possible.

**Remember**: "First, we explore without fences. Then, we build the fence. Then, we explore every inch of the playground."
